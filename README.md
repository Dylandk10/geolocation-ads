display ads for geolocation

Very useful for wordpress geo sponsorsship.
Simply make an image elements with the class name "geoImage1"
Add script to bottom of body
Done

htmlgeo-mutli is to display multiple geolocation ads while htmlgeo is a single ad. However, you can ad the multi for single use also. 

The two constants "sponsors" and "FALLBACK" are JS objects in which you can assign attributes such as url, img, lat and long, etc. This is how the algo knows what to display. Please note: all fields in the JS object are required.
